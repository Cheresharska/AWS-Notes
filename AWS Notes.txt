AWS Notes
AWS Well-Architected Framework
5 pillars:
1.	Operational Excellence - This pillar focuses on running and monitoring systems to deliver business value, and continually improving supporting processes and procedures. Key topics include managing and automating changes, responding to events, and defining standards to successfully manage daily operations.
There are six design principles for operational excellence in the cloud: 
	Perform operations as code
	Annotate documentation
	Make frequent, small, reversible changes
	Refine operations procedures frequently 
	Anticipate failure
	Learn from all operational failures

2.	Security - The Security pillar involves the ability to monitor and protect systems while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies. Key topics include protecting the confidentiality and integrity of data, identifying and managing who can do what (or privilege management), protecting systems, and establishing controls to detect security events.
Principals of security:
	Apply security at all layers
	Enable traceability
	Implement the principle of least privilege 
	Secure your system
	Automate security best practices

3.	Reliability - The Reliability pillar is concerned with the ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service failures, and to dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand and mitigate disruptions. Reliability can help you recover from failures and meet demand. Reliability in the cloud comprises three areas: Foundations, change management, and failure management. n addition, several design principles can increase reliability:
-	Testing recovery procedures
-	Testing recovery procedures
-	Scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability
-	Stop guessing capacity
-	Manage change in automation

4.	Performance Efficiency - The Performance Efficiency pillar refers to using computing resources efficiently while meeting system requirements. At the same time, it is important to maintain that efficiency as demand fluctuates and technologies evolve.
Factors that influence performance efficiency in the cloud include: 
-  Selection
-  Review
- Monitoring
- Tradeoffs


5.	Cost Optimization - Cost optimization refers to the ability to avoid or eliminate unneeded expenses and resources.
Components:
-	matching your supply with your demand
-	expenditure awareness
-	optimize over time
-	Adopt a consumption model
-	Measure overall efficiency
-	Reduce spending money on data center operations
-	Analyze and attribute expenditure
-	Use managed services
